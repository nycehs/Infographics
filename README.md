# Infographics
This includes core code cold, heat, asthma, and traffic infographics.

Cold and asthma are updated to be in a Core Framework shell.
Heat and traffic have a revised header to shell back to the portal, but additional integration with Core Framework may be problematic and require a full re-build.

See [Data Stories](https://nycehs.github.io/Infographics/DataStories.html) for content.
