,,,,Heat Vulnerability Index : Map
Indicator Description: <p>The Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) is a measure of how at-risk a neighborhood is during extreme heat compared to other neighborhoods. In NYC the risk of illness or death related to heat waves is higher in poor communities of color and communities with higher surface temperatures and less green space.</p>
Geography: Neighborhood (community district)
Measure: Score
How Calculated: <p>Each neighborhood receives a score from 1 (lowest risk) to 5 (highest risk) based on results from a statistical model that uses social and environmental factors to estimate risk of heat- related death across NYC neighborhoods.&nbsp;<strong>A low vulnerability score does not mean no risk</strong>.&nbsp; Everyneighborhood has residents at risk for heat illness and death particularly people who do not have or use air conditioning <strong>AND </strong>are older adults or have chronic health conditions or severe mental illnesses.</p>
