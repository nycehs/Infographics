,,,,Heat Stress Hospitalizations : Map
Indicator Description: Heat Stress Hospitalizations
Geography: Neighborhood (UHF 42)
Measure: Age-Adjusted Rate
How Calculated: NYC residents admitted to a NYC hospital during the months of May-Sep having an ICD-9 diagnosis code for effects of heat and light 992.0-992.9 or E-codes E900.0 or E900.9 for excessive heat due to weather conditions or undetermined cause. Must not have an E-code of E900.1 for excessive heat due to man-made conditions. Counts are summed by 5-year age groups and divided by the population in each age group using NYC DOHMH intercensal estimates; quotients are multiplied by the proportion of the 2000 US population in each age group.  Age-adjusted rate is the sum of the weighted age-specific rates; expressed as cases per 100000 residents.
